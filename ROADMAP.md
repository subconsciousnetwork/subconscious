# Subconscious Roadmap

## Purpose

**Subconscious is building the internet of ideas.**

Subconscious is your web3 notebook. We want to build a new kind of web-like ecosystem based on multiplayer social hypertext, like Twitter meets Wiki.

## Principles

**You own your data**: It's your second brain, not ours. Notes should last a lifetime. The only way to ensure this for you to retain ownership of your notes.

**Credible exit**: you must be able to usefully get your data out of Subconscious and into files, or other apps.

**Built on top of open protocols**: Like the web, Subconscious aims to build on top of general protocol primitives. New tools and apps (even competitors) should be able to usefully use the same markup and protocols that Subconscious uses.

**Open-ended**: Like the web, Subconscious aims to support open-ended evolution. When TBL launched the web it was just a small app for scientists to share papers, but it quickly evolved, becoming the networked app platform we have today. How? Permissionless innovation. Any user or developer can extend the system in new directions. The result is open-ended evolution.

## Plan

### Q1 2022 Alpha

Priority: "Self-organizing ideas". Launch a simple single-player alpha that focuses on helping you creatively diverge/converge.

- Diverge: the home view of Subconscious is a feed that surfaces prompts generated from your notes.
- Converge: the core game loop of Subconscious is search-or-create, that nudges you toward writing new ideas into old notes, slowly growing knowledge from the bottom-up.

Our hypothesis: the best edge-of-the-wedge is a mobile app that solves for "self-organizing ideas", a different goal from Roam/Obsidian/Notion.

- Mobile: existing tools for thought skew desktop web, leaving mobile to Apple Notes, which does not do much to help you develop ideas.
- Self-organizing ideas: Roam, Obsidian and Notion are like RPGs focused on knowledge graph worldbuilding. Subconscious wants to focus on lazy knowledge gardening. Easy ambient capture + microinteractions to generate and develop ideas.

#### Search-or-create flow

#### Generative home feed

#### Subtext

#### Save to files

### Q? 2022 Multiplayer

Priorities: launch multiplayer version that supports open sync, public and private notes.

#### Open sync

#### Distributed cloud infrastructure

### Q? 2022 Subspaces

Priorties: upgrade multiplayer to support "Subspaces" which support multi-user team note-taking.

## Future Goals

### Cooperatively-owned infrastructure 

### Geists

End-user scripting for your notes via sandboxed bots.
